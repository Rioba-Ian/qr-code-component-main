## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
### What I learned

The css part of using semantic tags instead of normal divs gave me an awakening. I've used main, article. 

Styling the footer with top and position absolute was a new part I learnt in this challenge. I honestly feel it was quite easy except for styling which took longer than I imagined. 

```css
.attribution {
    /* font-size: 11px;
    text-align: center; */
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 2rem;

}
```
Oh, btw another important part was 

```css
p {
  text-align: center
}
```


### Continued development

The areas I want to focus in future development are:

1. Sass
2. Javascript
3. Typescript
